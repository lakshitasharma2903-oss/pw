Text functions in excel - such as TRIM, LEFT,RIGHT,MID,and CONCATENATE are very useful in data cleaning because they help organize ,correct,and standardize text data. Here's how each one is used:-\n","1.  TRIM FUNCTION\n","> PURPOUSE:- Remove extra spaces from text ( except for single spaces between words).\n",">SYNTAX:- =TRIM(TEXT)\n",">Example :- if a cell contains\" Rajani Sharma \" =TRIM(A1)\n","Will return \"RAJANI SHARMA\"\n",">Removes unwanted spaces before or after names ,ids ,or addressses etc.\n","   \n","2. LEFT FUNCTION\n","> Purpose:- Extracts a spacifics number of characters from the left side of text.\n","> SYNTEX:- = LEFT( TEXT)\n",">EX:- IF A1 =\"2025- EXCEL \", =LEFT(A1,4) will return \"2025\"\n","* To separate codes ,years ,or prefices from data strings.\n","* Help when only part of a text (like first few digits )is needed.\n","\n","3. RIGHT FUNCTION\n",">Perpose :- Extracts charcterters from the right side of text .\n","> SYNTEX:-  =RIGHT (TEXT)\n","> If A1=\"2025-Excel\", =RIGHT (A1.5) will return \"Excel\".\n",">use in data cleaning.\n",">To extract suffixes ,lastnames, orending digits in ID'S OR PRODUCT CODES\n","\n","4.
